    <h1 id="centrality">What is graph centrality?</h1>
    <p>
      In graph theory and network analysis,
      indicators of centrality identify the most important vertices within a graph.
      Applications include identifying the most influential person(s) in a social network, key infrastructure nodes in the Internet or urban networks, and super-spreaders of disease.
      Centrality concepts were first developed in social network analysis, and many of the terms used to measure centrality reflect their sociological origin.
      They should not be confused with node influence metrics, which seek to quantify the influence of every node in the network.
    </p>
    <h3>Degree Centrality</h3>
    <p>
      Historically first and conceptually simplest is degree centrality, which is defined as the number of links incident upon a node (i.e., the number of ties that a node has).
      The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information).
      In the case of a directed network (where ties have direction), we usually define two separate measures of degree centrality, namely indegree and outdegree.
      Accordingly, indegree is a count of the number of ties directed to the node and outdegree is the number of ties that the node directs to others.
      When ties are associated to some positive aspects such as friendship or collaboration, indegree is often interpreted as a form of popularity, and outdegree as gregariousness.

    <h3>Closeness Centrality</h3>
    <p>
      In a connected graph, the normalized closeness centrality (or closeness) of a node is the average length of the shortest path between the node and all other nodes in the graph.
      Thus the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes.
    </p>
    <h3>Betweenness Centrality</h3>
    <p>
      Betweenness is a centrality measure of a vertex within a graph (there is also edge betweenness, which is not discussed here).
      Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes.
      It was introduced as a measure for quantifying the control of a human on the communication between other humans in a social network by Linton Freeman.
      In his conception, vertices that have a high probability to occur on a randomly chosen shortest path between two randomly chosen vertices have a high betweenness.
    </p>
    <h3>Eigenvector Centrality</h3>
    <p>Eigenvector centrality (also called eigencentrality) is a measure of the influence of a node in a network.
      It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in
      question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes. Google's PageRank and the Katz centrality are variants of the eigenvector centrality.

    <h1 id="customisation">How to customise Your graph</h1>
    <h3>Colors</h3>
    <p>
      Graph customisation is done under the Customise tab on the editor toolbar.
      You can change the colors that correspond to the currently chosen centrality measure.
      There are color pickers available for the minimum, median & maximum value of the chosen measure.
      Graph nodes are colored according to the chosen colors.
      You can also change the color of the connections between nodes.
      If the directed graph option was chosen during setup, then you can also change the color of the direction arrows.
    </p>
    <h3>Sizes</h3>
    <p>
      Lastly you can change the size of the graph nodes & edges manually. These are numbered values, that correspond to each node's radius in pixels.
    </p>
    <p>
      All changes that you make are applied by pressing the "Apply style" button.
